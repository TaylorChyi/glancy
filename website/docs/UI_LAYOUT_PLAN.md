# UI Layout Optimization Plan

This document outlines recommendations for refining the application layout and managing styles in a maintainable manner. The goal is to achieve a unified, minimal and premium look while keeping the codebase clean.

## Guidelines
- Adopt a component-based layout system with a shared `Layout` component that wraps page content.
- Centralize all design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) under `src/theme` for easier maintenance.
- Use CSS variables and utility classes to keep styles consistent across components.
- Prefer CSS modules or scoped styles to avoid leakage between components.
- Follow the Boy Scout Rule: always leave styles cleaner than you found them.

## Decoupled Tasks
1. **Design Tokens** – Expand `src/theme` to include variables for spacing and typography.
2. **Layout Component** – Create a `Layout.jsx` that renders header, sidebar and main content.
3. **Typography Scale** – Define font sizes and weights in `theme/typography.css`.
4. **Spacing Utilities** – Provide utility classes for margin and padding.
5. **Dark/Light Themes** – Ensure all components react to theme variables.
6. **Responsive Grid** – Introduce a grid system for consistent alignment.
7. **Button Styles** – Consolidate button appearance into a shared class.
8. **Form Elements** – Standardize input and form control styles.
9. **Icon Library** – Replace scattered SVG imports with a unified icon set.
10. **Modal Layout** – Create a modal container component for all dialog windows.
11. **Accessibility Audit** – Check color contrasts and keyboard navigation.
12. **Navigation Structure** – Refine sidebar and top bar structure for clarity.
13. **Animation Guidelines** – Document and apply smooth transitions.
14. **Code Splitting** – Load heavy components lazily to improve performance.
15. **State Management Review** – Ensure UI state is kept in stores or context.
16. **Error Boundaries** – Wrap major sections with error boundary components.
17. **Testing Utilities** – Add unit tests for layout components.
18. **Linting for Styles** – Integrate a CSS linter to enforce conventions.
19. **CI Workflow** – Add automated checks for lint and build on pull requests.
20. **Documentation** – Maintain this plan and update progress regularly.
